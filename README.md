# scripts

Essentials that I have written and cannot live without anymore.

This has grown in an anarchistic way. Some scripts have -h / -u for
printing usage information, some don't. When in doubt, read the source
code.

## dict

Look up a German/English translation in dict.cc

Usage: `dict [-h | words...]`  
Example: `dict talk to the hand`
